"Designed for loving husbands looking to surprise their wives with heartwarming gifts, the quirky mechanism will automatically lock your door anytime you open an incognito window, giving you the chance to browse for presents without having to worry about getting caught in the act of… caring." -Mikey Nichol

Mikey Nichol the creator of the Toilet Paper Machine™ and the Toilet Paper Machine 2.0™ had the awesome idea to build an Incognito-Lock to automatically lock his door while private browsing.
Based on his Idea I'd like to build the FapLight: A remote controlled "On Air" light that lights up when you stream on twitch or switch to private mode.

I'd also like to replace the Arduino with an esp8266 microcontroller and control the state of the light with websockets.
